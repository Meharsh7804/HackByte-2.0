# Efforts towards Digital Anonymity

## Password Encryption

Implemented encryption for saving passwords in the backend. By hashing passwords, we ensure that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain anonymous. Only the users themselves know their passwords.

## Feedback Name Anonymity

Implemented user anonymity for feedback messages, enhancing trust by not displaying users' names alongside their messages.
